# In the sense of transparence

## Code

This codebase is the generative element for my piece "In the sense of
transparence," written for Severine Ballon.

### Requirements

## Program note

**clarity, in the sense of silence**  
(solo cello)

*In the sense of transparence* (2015) is inspired by and constructed from two
sections of George Oppen’s 1968 long poem “Of Being Numerous.” It repeats two
key sections of the poem, which like an invocation calls for us to see things
outside of ourselves, with clarity and with the knowledge that each of us is
surrounded by others. The rhythm and intonation of the cello is drawn from a
1968 recording of the poet reading at Berkeley, broadcast on KPFA. This piece
was written for Séverine Ballon.

From "Of Being Numerous," by George Oppen

Obsessed, bewildered

By the shipwreck  
Of the singular

We have chosen the meaning  
Of being numerous.

Clarity

In the sense of transparence,  
I don’t mean that much can be explained  

Clarity in the sense of silence.
